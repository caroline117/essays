**IAGO** </br>
Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you, </br>
Not to affect many proposèd matches </br>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, </br>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends— </br>
Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank, </br>
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural— </br>
But pardon me—I do not in position </br>
Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear </br>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, </br>
May fall to match you with her country forms </br>
And happily repent. </br> 


**SAMPLE COMMENTARY** </br>


**OTHELLO**  </br>
Farewell, farewell! </br>
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more. </br>
Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. </br>
IAGO (beginning to exit)  My lord, I take my leave. </br>

**OTHELLO**  </br>
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless </br>
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. </br>


**IAGO** (returning) </br>
My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor </br>
To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time. </br>
Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place— </br>
For sure he fills it up with great ability— </br>
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, </br>
You shall by that perceive him and his means. </br>
Note if your lady strain his entertainment </br>
With any strong or vehement importunity. </br>
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime, </br>
Let me be thought too busy in my fears— </br>
As worthy cause I have to fear I am— </br>
And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor. </br>

**OTHELLO**  </br>
Fear not my government. </br>

**IAGO**   </br>
I once more take my leave. (He exits) </br>

**OTHELLO** </br>
This fellow’s of exceeding honesty, </br>
And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit </br>
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, </br>
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, </br>
I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind </br>
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black </br>
And have not those soft parts of conversation </br>
That chamberers have, or for I am declined </br>
Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much— </br>
She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief </br>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage, </br>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours </br>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad </br>
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon </br>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love </br>
For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones; </br>
Prerogatived are they less than the base. </br>
